# Motivation for a BCP-47 Language Tag Validation Library

## The Problem: Browsers and Language Tag Validation

In web development, language tags are critical for internationalization, accessibility, and proper content rendering. However, there is a significant gap in how browsers validate and handle these tags.

### Current Browser Behavior

Most mainstream browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) have a surprisingly lax approach to language tag validation:

1. **Minimal Validation**: Browsers perform little to no validation against the BCP-47 standard

   - They accept syntactically incorrect tags like `<html lang="en--US">`
   - They don't reject tags with non-existent subtags (e.g., `<html lang="xx-YY">`)
   - Even completely invalid formats are often accepted

2. **Inconsistent Handling**: Each browser handles invalid language tags differently

   - Some features like spellchecking may use the nearest valid language tag ancestor
   - Text-to-speech engines may fall back to default languages
   - Font selection algorithms may ignore the language entirely

3. **Silent Failures**: When language tags are invalid, browsers fail silently
   - No console warnings or errors
   - No indication to developers that their language tags are problematic
   - Issues only become apparent when language-specific features behave unexpectedly

### Real-world Consequences

This permissive behavior leads to significant issues:

- **Accessibility problems**: Screen readers may use incorrect pronunciation rules
- **Incorrect rendering**: Font selection, text direction, and hyphenation may be wrong
- **SEO implications**: Search engines may misclassify content language
- **Internationalization bugs**: Content may display incorrectly for international users
- **Maintenance challenges**: Invalid tags might work in one browser but fail in another

## The Gap: Missing Validation Libraries

Despite the importance of correct language tags, there is a surprising lack of comprehensive validation libraries:

1. **Existing libraries are incomplete**: Most libraries only handle basic syntax checking without full BCP-47 compliance
2. **Registry integration is lacking**: Few libraries validate against the full IANA Language Subtag Registry
3. **No canonicalization**: Existing solutions rarely handle tag normalization and canonicalization
4. **Limited platform support**: Libraries often target specific languages or platforms
5. **Poor documentation**: Available tools frequently lack clear documentation and examples

As a result, developers are left to either:

- Implement their own validation logic (error-prone and time-consuming)
- Use incomplete libraries that miss critical validation aspects
- Ignore validation entirely and hope for the best

## The Solution: A Comprehensive BCP-47 Validation Library

There's a clear need for a robust, well-documented library that:

1. Implements the complete BCP-47 specification (RFC 5646)
2. Validates against the IANA Language Subtag Registry
3. Supports canonicalization and normalization
4. Provides detailed error messages and suggestions
5. Works across multiple platforms and languages
6. Includes comprehensive documentation and examples

Such a library would:

- **Improve accessibility** by ensuring screen readers have correct language information
- **Enhance internationalization** by guaranteeing proper language tag usage
- **Simplify development** by catching language tag issues early
- **Ensure consistency** across different browsers and platforms
- **Future-proof applications** against evolving standards

By creating this library, we aim to fill a significant gap in the web development ecosystem and make proper language tag implementation accessible to all developers.
