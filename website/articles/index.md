# Articles on Language Implementation

This section contains articles and guides on the practical implementation and importance of language tags in web applications.

## Why Language Tags Matter

Proper language tagging is a crucial but often overlooked aspect of web development. Implementing language tags correctly:

- **Improves accessibility** for users with screen readers and other assistive technologies
- **Enhances SEO** by helping search engines understand and index your content properly
- **Supports internationalization** efforts by making language-specific functionality work correctly
- **Ensures compliance** with accessibility standards like WCAG, ADA, Section 508, and EAA

According to the [WebAIM Million report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/), missing or incorrect language tags remain one of the most common accessibility issues on the web, affecting millions of websites.

- Set the language tag on any content that differs from the page's primary language
- Ensure your language tags are properly canonicalized (e.g., `en-US`, not `EN-us`)
- Include regional variants when relevant to your content (e.g., `pt-BR` vs `pt-PT`)
- Verify your language tags with a validator like ally-bcp-47
