# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# BCP-47 Language Tag Validation Library

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Create a comprehensive TypeScript library for validating BCP-47 language tags that fully implements the RFC 5646 specification and addresses the significant gaps in existing solutions.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current libraries for language tag validation in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem are incomplete, outdated, or insufficiently maintained. This creates challenges for developers implementing proper internationalization and accessibility features, leading to potential issues in language rendering, screen reader functionality, and SEO.

### 1.3 Target Users

- Web developers implementing internationalization features
- Framework developers building i18n tools
- Accessibility specialists ensuring proper language identification
- Content management system developers
- SEO specialists

## 2. User Stories

- As a web developer, I want to validate language tags to ensure they are properly formatted according to BCP-47.
- As an accessibility specialist, I want to ensure screen readers have correct language information for proper pronunciation.
- As a framework developer, I want to incorporate robust language tag validation into my internationalization tools.
- As a content manager, I want to validate language tags in content to ensure proper display across different locales.
- As a developer, I want detailed error messages when language tags are invalid so I can fix them correctly.
- As a developer, I want to canonicalize language tags to ensure consistency across my application.
