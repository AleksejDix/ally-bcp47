# Section 508 Compliance Documentation

This document outlines how the BCP-47 language tag validation library supports compliance with Section 508 requirements for federal agencies and contractors.

## What is Section 508?

Section 508 is official US legislation enforcing accessibility requirements for federally-funded information and communication technology (ICT) and third parties providing services to federal entities. The US Access Board published its latest Section 508 revision in 2017, which is based on WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards, with WCAG 2.2 now being the recommended standard.

Section 508 requirements include:

- **Websites**: Federal-funded websites and related third parties must comply with WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards (WCAG 2.2 recommended)
- **Content**: Official federal content must be accessible in forms that accommodate different disabilities
- **Software & apps**: Technology must be compatible with assistive technologies used by people with disabilities

## Language Tag Requirements for Section 508 Compliance

### Core Requirements

1. **Proper Language Identification**:

   - Content must be properly identified with valid BCP-47 language tags
   - All federal websites must properly declare the primary language of pages
   - All changes in language within content must be properly marked

2. **Multi-language Support**:

   - Federal agencies must support multiple languages as required by Executive Order 13166
   - Language tags must properly identify all supported languages

3. **Assistive Technology Compatibility**:
   - Language tags must work correctly with screen readers, text-to-speech, and other assistive technologies
   - Tags must include appropriate extensions for accessibility features

   - Properly identifying the primary language of each page

   - Properly identifying changes in language within content

3. **Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast)**
   - Supporting contrast extensions for visual presentation

## Best Practices for Federal Agencies

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Standard Government Tags**

   - Use the appropriate ISO language codes
   - Apply standardized private use extensions for government content
   - Follow canonical case formatting

2. **Content Accessibility**

   - Apply appropriate extensions for different user needs
   - Test language tags with common assistive technologies

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Validate all language tags to ensure proper format
   - Use canonical forms with proper case normalization

## Testing for Section 508 Compliance

The library includes dedicated tests for Section 508 compliance:

```bash
